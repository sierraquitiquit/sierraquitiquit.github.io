									<h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
									<p>Afoot and light-hearted I take to the open road,
										Healthy, free, the world before me,
										The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.<br>

										Henceforth I ask not good-fortune, I myself am good-fortune,
										Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing,
										Done with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms,
										Strong and content I travel the open road.<br>

										The earth, that is sufficient,
										I do not want the constellations any nearer,
										I know they are very well where they are,
										I know they suffice for those who belong to them.<br>

										Allons! the road is before us!
										It is safe—I have tried it—my own feet have tried it well—be not detain’d!<br>

										Camerado, I give you my hand!
										I give you my love more precious than money,
										I give you myself before preaching or law;
										Will you give me yourself? will you come travel with me?
										Shall we stick by each other as long as we live?</p>

									<p>So shocking watching person after person leave their trash on the beach. I picked this up plus a few more handfuls within a 30 foot radius of myself. Even more shocking is that there were literally dozens of trash cans a few seconds walk. This truly breaks my heart. ☠ Plastic is Poison ☠ Every piece of plastic that has every been created still exists today, it NEVER goes away. Although a small portion of plastic is recycled the large majority of it ends up in land fills or the ocean where it breaks down in to smaller and smaller pieces as it poisons marine life and ends up in our drinking water. I’m no saint, I threw that plastic in the trash instead of taking it with me and finding a recycling vestibule and I do consume plastics from time to time but I’m conscious of my consumption and I’m truly trying my best. I don’t leave home without a reusable water, a pair of chopsticks and a mason jar. These little efforts have helped me in massively reducing my plastic footprint. Every time we use a plastic cup or fork and throw it away we need to understand the magnitude of that decision. We have the opportunity to do better for ourselves, the next generation and this amazing planet. 🌎 Tag a friend or company that’s doing their part 💚 #onelove #fuckplastic #itnevergoesaway (at Malibu Beach)</p>

									<p>The van got a few upgrades like a bed extension, a new stereo and her little snack jars filled up with the goodies. Feels good to be sprawled out, jamming to good tunes, well fed, but most of all just feeling good to breathe fresh air, stick my feet in the dirt and watch the stars. #vanlife #killingit #uintas (at High Uintas)</p>

									<p>NYC bound! It’s kinda funny, one day in the backcountry rappelling in to a couloir and the next getting my hair and make up done on set. Being a small town mountain girl I used to trip about the duality of these two worlds. Now I see what a blessing it is to have my world expanded in so many different directions. To be able to see the world through the dramatically different lenses of a pro athlete and a model. 🙏 In the beginning I think it was hard because I felt like people were trying to compartmentalize me, I was trying to compartmentalize myself even. 😂 Model or Athlete? The answer is both. Plus so much more… Human Being! Our minds are conditioned to compartmentalize so we can understand, create familiarity and somehow that makes the world a little more digestible and feel safe. It’s so sad actually because with that conditioning comes with so much suffocation. Every person and every path is original, unique and limitless. There are no rules to life. But society has a way of shaming us in to the familiar, even if it doesn’t honor our true selves. I just want to let you know that I believe in you and encourage you to walk your path with courage and with respect to your true self. Don’t look around you, because most people are living from fear, look inside you. You are limitless!! ✨💛🤘 #sendit 📷 @gallerycoco</p>

									<p>Walkabouts in the Wasatch providing me some quality time for conscious reflection. I’ve been thinking a lot about the circumstantial agreements we make with ourselves. Ya know, those “if this happened or this stopped happening, then I would be so happy” …sort of deals that we all make in our minds. Well, what if we could root our happiness in something deeper than the daily and weekly circumstances of our lives. Basically remove ourselves from the roller coaster of external shit that happens all around us. So I’ve been working on this idea of being the rock in the river, steady amongst the current. I’ve found my most powerful tools are #meditation and #gratitude. Meditation because it creates a sort of blank, still space in the mind that is more easily accessible in times of stress or crisis. And gratitude because I truly believe this is the most powerful tool we have in life. Our realities our built entirely upon perspective and having one filled with gratitude (for the big and little things in life) will create a reality that feel rich, abundant and a little bit more steady in the storms. #walkabouts #rants #choosegratitude 😊🙏🏼😊</p>
